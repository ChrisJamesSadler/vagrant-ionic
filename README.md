# vagrant-ionic
Vagrant box for ionic developers

# Introduction
Instead of building a virtual machine from scratch, which would be a slow and tedious process, Vagrant uses a base image to quickly clone a virtual machine.
These base images are known as "boxes" in Vagrant. This is a prepackaged development environment to work with your Ionic projects.
